# This service continuously runs in background subscribing to opening channel requests,
# and filtering opening request by applying rules and settings.
#
# Some examples are explained here: 
# https://github.com/niteshbalusu11/BOS-Commands-Document#inbound-channel-rules
# and https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis#inbound-channel-rules
# 
# Explanation of settings below:
# - capacity of a requested channel >= 10M sats
# - CLEARNET: peer must have a clearnet address
# - NOT(OBSOLETE): channel has to be of type anchors
# - NOT(PUBLIC_KEY = 'x'): pubkey is not allowed to open channel to us
# - coop-close-address(es): cycle through given addresses and add them as coop-close address to opening channels
